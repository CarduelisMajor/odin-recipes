        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the simplest thing to.. well.. let's call it "cook" to fill your empty stomach and therby enable you to continue on your Odin-quests. If that's not sufficient reason to you to try it out, consider becoming a chef instead of torturing yourself to try and become a web developer.</p>
        <h2> Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sausages:</strong> Get the good stuff. Seriously. No canned sausages, nor the ones sold in glasses. Get the ones from the cooling shelf, or, if you're feeling exceptionally fancy today, from your local butcher. Be cautious not to buy Bratwurst, which is meant to be grilled or fried in a pan.</li>
            <li><strong>Potato Salad:</strong> Opposite to the above: Get the cheapest you can get. There is no noticeable difference in quality between the brands. If you prefer the one with an oil-vinegar-dressing, get it, if you prefer mayonnaise, you sadly have a disgusting taste and should be ashamed of yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to make Sausages with Potato Salad</h2>
        <p><em>Seriously?</em></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a pot, pan, electric kettle or whatever vessel you're comfortable with smelling like sausages afterwards. Fill it with water, get the water to boiling temperature by using whatever source of heat is available to you. <p>If you don't have access to a heat source, but have an electric wall socket right next to you and a spare cable to your disposal, you can also just short circuit the vessel by attaching the positive wire to one side and the negative to the other side. This requires the vessel to be conductive though. It also almost certainly changes your cause of death from longsome starvation to a very sudden <strong>electrocution</strong>.</p></li>
            <li>Turn off the heat source/unplug the cables and add the quality sausages to the hot water. Close with a lid and let sit for five to ten minutes.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, get a plate from your cupboard. <strong>Pro tip:</strong> if you're really close to deadline with your web development project, wrap the plate in cling wrap. This way, you don't have to do the dishes afterwards, but simply throw away the wrapping afterwards. Don't tell your environmentally aware girlfriend you got that life hack from me please.</li>
            <li>Arrange the potato salad on the plate.</li>
            <li>After the time span mentioned above, place the sausages right next to the potato salad on the plate</li>
            <li>If you wish (which you don't, as in this case you'd obviously cook a proper meal) you can now decorate the whole thing using fresh parsley, a hard boiles egg or pickles.</li>
            <li>Finished. Should I congratulate you on that? Enjoy your meal!</li>
